table with languages

without flags, takes more energy

For binarytrees: php cosumes the most, python ruby and csharp also relatively bad 
For fannkuchredux: php python ruby really bad, javascript also not so good
For fasta: php python ruby javascript not good
For mandelbrot: python php ruby not good
For nbody: python php ruby not good
For revcomp: not one that really stands out, though c++-noflags has a huge range thus potentially really bad
For spectralnorm: python least good, php ruby also not good

Overall php, python and ruby not good conform the energy consumption
